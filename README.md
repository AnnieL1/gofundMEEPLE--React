# gofundMEEPLE - Frontend (React.js)

gofundMEEPLE* connects boardgame creators and boardgame enthusiasts together to bring boardgames to life. Creators will be able to launch their projects on gofundMEEPLE and enthusiasts can back the project by making pledges. Pledgers will be able to submit fan-based ideas for the final stretch goal**, and once/if the final stretch goal is reached creators must choose one (or more) fan-based idea and make it come to life!

*Meeple: small figures used as a playing piece in boardgames and have a similar appearance to human figures **Stretch goals: additional features the boardgame creators include within the boardgame once a certain amount of funding has been reached. It may differ based on pledge levels.

This project has been created in React.js as part of the She Codes Plus bootcamp JavaScript & React module. It involved creating the endpoints and API for a crowdfunding website. The frontend will be built out as part of the JavaScript & React module.
